The simplest way to develop a GUI application running on Arch Linux with KDE Plasma and written in Node.js is to use the Electron framework. Electron allows you to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is well-suited for creating GUI applications with Node.js on Linux.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**

   If you don't already have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed, you can install them using your package manager on Arch Linux. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
   ```

2. **Create a New Electron Project:**

   You can use a tool like `electron-forge` to quickly scaffold a new Electron project. Install it globally using npm:

   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g electron-forge
   ```

   Then, create a new Electron project:

   ```bash
   npx electron-forge init my-electron-app
   cd my-electron-app
   ```

3. **Develop Your GUI Application:**

   Inside your Electron project folder, you'll find a `src` directory where you can place your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can use popular web development libraries and frameworks like React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JS to create your GUI.

   Customize the `src/index.html` file for your application's interface.

4. **Run Your Electron Application:**

   To run your Electron application during development, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch your Electron app, and you can see your GUI in a standalone window.

5. **Package and Distribute Your Application:**

   Once you've developed your GUI application and are ready to distribute it, you can use Electron Forge to package it into an executable for various platforms, including Linux. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run make
   ```

   This will generate a distributable package for Linux in the `out/make` directory.

6. **Install KDE Plasma Integration (Optional):**

   If you want to integrate your Electron application better with the KDE Plasma desktop environment, you can explore additional libraries and tools designed for KDE integration. One such library is `plasma-browser-integration`. You can install it and follow the documentation to enable specific KDE features in your Electron app.

That's it! You now have a simple Electron-based GUI application that can run on Arch Linux with KDE Plasma. You can further customize and enhance your application based on your project requirements.
