To include some Arch User Repository (AUR) packages in the installation of the Arch Linux ISO you want to create (custom Archiso), you can follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Custom Archiso Environment:**

   You'll need to set up a custom Archiso environment to create your customized ISO. If you haven't already done this, you can follow the Arch Wiki's guide on creating a custom Archiso environment: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archiso#Installation_and_setup

   Essentially, you'll clone the Archiso repository, modify the configurations, and build the custom environment.

2. **Edit the `packages.x86_64` File:**

   In your custom Archiso environment, locate the `packages.x86_64` file. This file contains a list of packages that will be included in the installation environment of your ISO.

   You can add the AUR packages you want to install to this list. Simply append the package names to the file, one package per line. For example:

   ```plaintext
   base
   base-devel
   package-name-aur
   another-aur-package
   ```

   Replace `package-name-aur` and `another-aur-package` with the actual names of the AUR packages you want to include.

3. **Build Your Custom ISO:**

   After editing the `packages.x86_64` file, you can proceed to build your custom Arch Linux ISO by running the following command from within your custom Archiso environment directory:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh -v
   ```

   The `-v` flag is for verbose output, which can help you see the progress and any potential issues during the build process.

4. **Retrieve AUR Packages During Installation:**

   During the installation of your custom ISO, you can use an AUR helper like `yay` to retrieve and install AUR packages. You can include `yay` in your custom Archiso environment by adding it to the `packages.x86_64` file, just like any other package.

   Once you have your custom ISO and you boot into it, you can use `yay` to install AUR packages as needed. For example:

   ```bash
   yay -S aur-package-name
   ```

   Replace `aur-package-name` with the actual name of the AUR package you want to install.

Remember that when you create a custom Arch Linux ISO, you're essentially creating a live environment, and you can customize it as you see fit, including adding and installing AUR packages. However, keep in mind that including too many packages in your ISO may increase its size significantly.
