To install .NET Core on Arch Linux, you can use the official .NET Core SDK package provided by Microsoft. Here are the steps to install .NET Core on Arch Linux:

1. Open a terminal on your Arch Linux system.

2. Update the package database to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```

3. Install the .NET Core SDK package. You can use the `dotnet-sdk` package from the Arch User Repository (AUR). To use an AUR helper like `yay`, run:

   ```bash
   yay -S dotnet-sdk
   ```

   If you don't have `yay` or another AUR helper installed, you can manually build and install the package using the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
   cd yay
   makepkg -si
   ```

4. After successfully installing the .NET Core SDK, you can verify the installation by running:

   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```

   This command should display the installed .NET Core version.

That's it! You now have .NET Core installed on your Arch Linux system. You can start developing and running .NET Core applications on your system.
