Creating a custom Arch Linux live CD with an Electron application running without a desktop environment is a multi-step process. You'll be using `archiso`, a tool for creating a live CD/USB for Arch Linux, and setting up an environment where your Electron application can run directly on Xorg without a full desktop environment.

### Step 1: Install Archiso

First, install `archiso` on your Arch Linux system. This package contains scripts for building the live CD/USB.

```bash
sudo pacman -S archiso
```

### Step 2: Copy the Archiso Files

Create a working directory and copy the necessary `archiso` files into it.

```bash
mkdir ~/archlive
cp -r /usr/share/archiso/configs/releng/* ~/archlive
```

### Step 3: Customize the Live Environment

Edit the files in `~/archlive` to customize your live environment. 

- **Packages**: Modify the `packages.x86_64` file to include the packages your Electron app requires (`xorg-server`, `xorg-xinit`, `xorg-drivers` for basic Xorg, and any dependencies of your Electron app).

- **Root Filesystem**: Customize the `airootfs` directory for any modifications in the root filesystem of the live environment. For instance, you can place your Electron application here or add a script to start it.

- **Boot Parameters**: Edit the `syslinux` and/or `EFI` boot loader configurations as needed. This is where you can set kernel parameters and other boot options.

### Step 4: Create a Custom xinit Script

Create a custom `.xinitrc` script to launch your Electron application. This script will start Xorg and then run your application. Place this script in the `airootfs/etc/skel/` directory so it becomes part of the user's home directory in the live environment.

Example `.xinitrc`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Start your Electron app here
/path/to/your/electron/app
```

### Step 5: Autostart Xorg

You'll want to automatically start Xorg and your application when the live system boots. One way to do this is to edit the existing startup scripts or create a new one in `airootfs/root/.automated_script.sh` or modify `airootfs/etc/systemd/system/`. 

For example, you could add a command to start Xorg with the user's `.xinitrc` script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-login as the live user and start X
su -l liveuser -c startx
```

### Step 6: Build the Live ISO

Run the `build.sh` script in your `~/archlive` directory to create the ISO.

```bash
cd ~/archlive
sudo ./build.sh -v
```

This will create the ISO in the `~/archlive/out/` directory.

### Step 7: Test Your Live Environment

Test your ISO in a virtual machine (like VirtualBox or QEMU) before using it on actual hardware to ensure everything works as expected.

### Additional Notes

- **Security**: Ensure that any scripts or binaries you include are secure and trustworthy, as they will run with full system access.
- **Maintenance**: Keep track of any customizations you make for future maintenance and rebuilding of your live environment.
- **Debugging**: If something doesn't work, use virtual machine snapshots to test iteratively and isolate the problem.

Creating a custom Arch Linux live environment is a powerful way to distribute a tailored Linux experience, but it requires careful planning and testing.
